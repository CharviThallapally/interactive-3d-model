# Interactive 3D Dog Model

## Overview
This project showcases a 3D interactive model of a dog. It uses **Three.js** to render the 3D model, and the **GLTFLoader** to load a `.glb` file. The model is interactive and allows the user to rotate and zoom in/out using the **OrbitControls**. The dog model can also be made to "jump" when the spacebar is pressed.

## Acknowledgements

## Technologies Used
